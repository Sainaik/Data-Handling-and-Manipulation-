# Data-Handling-and-Manipulation-

 I am attaching two files. (a) the folder "LABELS" contains label files for each image having image ID as the name of the file .Each label file contains labels (words) associated to the corresponding image by the ESP Game. Each file contains one label per line.  (b) file "WrongID" contains the ID (name) of few images. 

What i have to do 
1. create a csv file containing all the unique labels for each image id of the LABELS file except for the IDs of the WrongID file. i.e. create a csv file having all the unique labels as columns name all the image id as index and fill the matrix with 0 and 1 (like assignment 1). Your program should automatically exclude all the IDs of WrongID file while calculating unique tags from LABELS file.
2. calculate the frequency of all unique labels (column wise sum)

see code for what i did
